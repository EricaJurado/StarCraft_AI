    -A Barracks is built [trains our Marines]
    -Once barrack is built, an academy is built [allows Barracks to build Medics]
    -A Factory is built [to build Vultures, and will need it to build Siege Tanks]
    -Once a factory is built, a machine shop is built [now the factory can build Siege Tanks]
    -Bunkers **how many how often** are built to block the chokepoint [M&M will go in here to defend our buildings]
    -Missle Turrets are built on the ramp and near the mineral line

-The following units are built as preconditions (including resource amounts) are met:
    -Marines are built once there is a barracks. Three marines are built at a time.
    -Once three marines are built, one medic is built.
        -These four unites are then placed in an array so they can be treated as a group [called M&M]
        -This build order of three marines and one medic then restart
        -M&Ms enter empty bunkers; if no empty bunkers, they will **do a thing**
    -Once the Factory is built, build Vultures
        -Once two Vultures are built, cheese all 
    -Once the Machine Shop is built, build Siege Tanks
